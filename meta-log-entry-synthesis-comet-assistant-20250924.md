III. Decision Steps (Step-by-Step with Rationale)
1) Start from README to reuse canonical tone/fields → Decision: create standalone synthesis file to avoid conflation with architecture doc
2) Choose descriptive filename (agent+date+synthesis) → Decision: optimize searchability and provenance
3) Expand scope per updated task: automation, cloud-first, cross-dimensional mapping → Decision: add automation sections and cloud storage guidance
4) Receipts-first: log every source and workflow step with URLs/IDs → Decision: embed link fields and placeholders for source deep links

---

IV. Knowledge Handoffs (Past → Future)
- Inbound: Architectural standards from README; GitHub workflow; user task update requirements
- Outbound: Automation runbooks; canonical templates; cloud orchestration patterns; provenance storage schema
- Handoff Fields: {entry_id, sources[], artifacts[], decisions[], verification_links[], cloud_storage_locations[]}

VI. Automation Plans (Cloud-First, Minimal Local Load)
A) Notion Automation (Data/Receipt/Meta Extraction)
- Goal: Export pages, blocks, databases with provenance (page_id, block_id, database_id, last_edited_time)
- Cloud-first Strategy: Use Notion public integration with minimal scopes; run in a serverless job; write outputs to cloud object store
- Steps:
  1. OAuth integration (Notion internal integration or public app) → store token in cloud secret manager
  2. Enumerate sources via Notion search API; filter by tag/property for "meta-log"
  3. For each database/page: retrieve schema, properties, content blocks with /v1/databases, /v1/pages, /v1/blocks children
  4. Normalize to atomic dimensions: context, entity, process, relationship, receipts, resonance
  5. Emit receipts: notion://{page_id}|https://www.notion.so/{slug}?p={page_id}
  6. Store JSONL to cloud (e.g., s3://meta-logs/raw/notion/YYYY/MM/DD/) with checksum and source IDs
  7. Generate an index manifest (sources.json) with counts, timestamps, and hashes
- Template (JSON Canonical):
  {
    "source": "notion",
    "page_id": "",
    "database_id": "",
    "title": "",
    "last_edited_time": "",
    "atomic": {
      "context": [], "entities": [], "processes": [], "relationships": [],
      "receipts": ["https://www.notion.so/..."], "resonance": {"tags": [], "degree": "high|med|low"}
    },
    "provenance": {"collected_at": "ISO", "collector": "comet-assistant", "hash": "sha256"}
  }

B) Google Docs Automation
- Goal: Extract doc structure (headings, paragraphs, tables), revisions, and share links with provenance
- Cloud-first Strategy: Use Google Drive/Docs APIs from cloud function; enforce least-privileged scopes; store artifacts in cloud
- Steps:
  1. Service account with domain-wide delegation or OAuth user consent; secrets in cloud secret manager
  2. Query Drive for files matching labels/folders: label:meta-log or parent folder "Meta Logs"
  3. For each Doc: use Docs API to export structure; optionally export as JSON via Google Docs API batch requests
  4. Map elements to atomic dimensions; extract documentId, revisionId, webViewLink
  5. Emit receipts: https://docs.google.com/document/d/{documentId}/edit?usp=sharing; revision URLs if available
  6. Store JSONL and rendered markdown to cloud object storage (e.g., s3://meta-logs/raw/gdocs/YYYY/MM/DD/)
  7. Update manifest with counts, timestamps, and hashes
- Template (JSON Canonical):
  {
    "source": "gdocs",
    "document_id": "",
    "title": "",
    "revision_id": "",
    "atomic": {"context": [], "entities": [], "processes": [], "relationships": [], "receipts": ["..."], "resonance": {"tags": [], "degree": ""}},
    "provenance": {"webViewLink": "", "collected_at": "ISO", "hash": "sha256"}
  }

C) Browser History / Workflow Automation
- Goal: Capture task-relevant navigation, actions, DOM receipts, and timestamps; avoid local-heavy processing
- Cloud-first Strategy: Stream sanitized event logs to cloud via lightweight browser extension or headless agent emitting only necessary metadata
- Steps:
  1. Instrument browser agent to emit events: {url, title, timestamp, action, node_selector, result_state}
  2. Redact sensitive fields client-side; batch events and send to cloud ingestion endpoint
  3. Enrich in cloud with de-duplication, sessionization, and URL canonicalization
  4. Map to atomic dimensions; attach receipts (URLs, anchors, commit hashes)
  5. Store as append-only log in cloud (parquet/JSONL) with partitioning by date/session
- Template (Event JSON):
  {"source":"browser","session_id":"","event_id":"","ts":"","url":"","action":"click|navigate|form_fill|download","details":{},"receipts":["url","commit"],"provenance":{"agent":"comet-assistant","hash":"sha256"}}

VII. Cross-Dimensional Mapping Strategies & Templates
- Atomic Dimensions:
  - Context: where/when/why; fields: system, location, time, task_id
  - Entity: who/what; fields: type, id, name, attributes
  - Process: how; fields: steps[], inputs[], outputs[]
  - Relationship: links among entities/processes; fields: source_id, target_id, type
  - Receipts: evidence; fields: url, id, hash, timestamp
  - Resonance: significance; fields: tags[], score, rationale
- Mapping Template (unified):
  {
    "context": {...},
    "entities": [...],
    "processes": [...],
    "relationships": [...],
    "receipts": [...],
    "resonance": {...},
    "provenance": {"collector":"comet-assistant","collected_at":"ISO","hash":"sha256"}
  }
- Translation Guidance:
  1) Normalize IDs (notion.page_id, gdocs.document_id, github.commit) into namespaced IDs
  2) Use controlled vocab for entity types: {document, page, database, commit, repo, user}
  3) Store links in both human (webViewLink) and API (resource ID) forms
  4) Apply consistent timestamps (UTC ISO 8601)
  5) Hash all payloads for immutability and change detection

VIII. Best Practices: Cross-System Translation & Resonance Layering
- Use schema registries for atomic templates; version them (v1, v1.1)
- Create enrichment pipelines: tag resonance based on usage, references, and task-criticality
- Avoid duplication: maintain a global artifact index keyed by {source, id}
- Prefer cloud compute (serverless/batch) for normalization; keep client lightweight
- Implement access controls and redaction rules upstream; store only minimum necessary metadata
- Maintain auditability: append-only logs, immutable object storage with lifecycle policies

---

IX. Cloud Orchestration & Provenance Storage
- Storage Layout (example S3/GCS):
  s3://meta-logs/
    raw/{notion|gdocs|browser}/YYYY/MM/DD/*.jsonl
    manifests/YYYY/MM/DD/sources.json
    normalized/atomic/YYYY/MM/DD/*.parquet
    indexes/global-artifact-index.json
- Provenance Fields:
  {"source":"","id":"","web_url":"","api_url":"","hash":"","collected_at":"","collector":"comet-assistant","lineage":["ingest","normalize","index"]}
- Interoperability:
  - Export normalized atomic artifacts as Open Data JSON/Parquet
  - Provide signed URLs for downstream agents
  - Use event-driven updates (e.g., object-created → index update → notification)
- Zero Redundant Local Computation:
  - Cache in cloud; client requests get pre-normalized artifacts
  - Idempotent processing keyed by content hash

X. How-To: Automate Each Extraction Step (Stepwise Plans)
Notion
1. Create integration; capture token in cloud secrets
2. Curate source DB/pages; tag with "meta-log"
3. Nightly serverless job: search → retrieve → paginate → store raw JSONL
4. Normalize to atomic template; compute sha256; write to normalized bucket
5. Update manifests and artifact index; publish receipts

Google Docs
1. Configure service account/OAuth; store credentials in secrets
2. Define folder/labels; list docs; filter by label/folder
3. Batch export structure via Docs API; capture revisions
4. Normalize to atomic; compute sha256; store raw + md render
5. Update manifests/index; publish receipts

Browser History/Workflow
1. Instrument agent/extension to emit minimal events
2. Batch to cloud ingestion; redact PII client-side
3. Cloud enrich: sessionize, dedupe, canonicalize URLs
4. Normalize to atomic; compute sha256; store
5. Update manifests/index; publish receipts

XI. Templates & Canonical Fields (Repo-Aligned)
- entry:
  entry_id, date, entry_type, agent, context, objectives[], artifacts[], decisions[], handoffs[], verification_links[], automation_plans[], cloud_locations[], provenance
- artifact:
  source, id, title, url, hash, collected_at, atomic{context,entities,processes,relationships,receipts,resonance}
- event:
  session_id, event_id, ts, url, action, details, receipts[], provenance

---

XII. Future Cloud-Managed Meta-Entries
- Use index-driven creation: new entries auto-link prior artifacts via global index
- Trigger-based workflows: when new source object arrives, auto-generate meta entry draft in cloud and PR to this repo
- Interop: provide JSON schema and OpenAPI for atomic artifacts; downstream agents consume directly
- Governance: enforce PR checks validating receipts and hashes

---

Conclusion
This expanded entry operationalizes automation and cloud-first aggregation while standardizing cross-dimensional mapping. It enables interoperable, receipts-first meta-logging with minimal local compute and full provenance for audit and orchestration.
